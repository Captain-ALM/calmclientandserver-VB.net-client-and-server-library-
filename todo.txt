Add support for relays

Add proper return values from functions (Instead of booleans)

(X)Merge MSG and packet classes (so packet can return bytes and consume bytes)

(X)Change intmsg to packet_frame and have packts placed into frames to stop endofstream errors (the buffer is too small / packet is too big for buffer)

(X)fix If statement order bugs, add try-catch blocks

check for nulls and make sure threads are closed

(X)fix encryption errors that may come

(X)add prototype structures to create client and server instead of certain paramenters
